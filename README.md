# Statistics-Calculator
This Calculator uses the formulas and methods to find the statistical values listed.

Statistics Calculator module for all types of Stats calculations.

## Programs To Perform By This Module
  ### Central tendency: 

    1.	Mean, median, mode, Standard deviation and Variance
    
  ### Hypothesis testing:
  
    2.	t-test for single mean    
    3.	t-test for difference of two means    
    4.	F-test for equality of population variances
    5.	Sample Mean
    6.	Sample Standard Deviation
    7.	Sample Variance
    8.	Sample Proportion
    9.	Difference of two independent sample means
    10.	Difference of two independent sample standard deviations
    11.	Difference of two independent sample proportions
    
  ### Interval Estimation
  
    12.	Confidence interval for a normal mean
    13.	Confidence interval for a normal mean when the variance is unknown
    14.	Confidence limits for standard deviation
    15.	Confidence limits for difference of population means

## Usage
  ```Python
  import CalModule
  
  # Calls the Central Tendency function which can print mean, median, 
  # mode, Std. and Variance.
  m.Central_Tendency()
  
  # Calls the Central Tendency function which can print sample mean.
  m.Sample_Mean()
  
  # Calls the function to print Confidence interval for a normal mean 
  # when the variance is unknown.
  m.UnknownVariance()
  ```
