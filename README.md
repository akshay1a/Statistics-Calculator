  Hypothesis testing:
  
    3.	t-test for single mean    
    4.	t-test for difference of two means    
    5.	F-test for equality of population variances
    6.	Sample Mean
    7.	Sample Standard Deviation
    8.	Sample Variance
    9.	Sample Proportion
    10.	Difference of two independent sample means
    11.	Difference of two independent sample standard deviations

  Interval Estimation
  
    13.	Confidence interval for a normal mean
    14.	Confidence interval for a normal mean when the variance is unknown
    15.	Confidence limits for standard deviation
